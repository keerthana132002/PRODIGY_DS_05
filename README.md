TRAFFIC ACCIDENT ANALYSIS
This project involves analyzing a traffic accident dataset to identify patterns and trends. The analysis includes:

Data Loading and Cleaning: Imported necessary libraries and loaded the dataset. Checked for and handled missing values by dropping columns with excessive missing data and filling missing categorical values with the mode.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed EDA by checking the distribution of accident severity, finding duplicate values, and understanding the dataset's structure using descriptive statistics and data type checks.

Pattern Identification: Analyzed the distribution of accident severity and plotted relationships between features like the number of casualties and vehicles involved.

Visualizations: Created various visualizations, including scatter plots and joint plots, to explore correlations and patterns in the data.
